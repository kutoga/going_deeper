- Loss-Difference for computing the weight of the "delta-weights":
  - Only use the difference of the first loss-term (e.g. BCE)
- Validation loss selection
  - Use the minimal loss according to the first loss term (without the delta weights)
- How does pytorch initialize the weights (especially of the runtime added layers)?
- Simplify the computation of the delta w weight: It should use smaller values
